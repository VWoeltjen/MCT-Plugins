# A file containing abbreviations of words and phrases.
#
# Each property should be of the form:
#   phrase = alt1 | alt2 | ...
#
# For example, to abbreviate "Voltage" to "Volts" or "V":
#
#   Voltage = Volts | V
#
# Note: The original phrase is always available as an abbreviation
# without having to specify it. So in the above example there are 3
# possible abbreviations for Voltage: Voltage, Volts, and V.
#
# Spaces around the equals sign (=) and around the pipe symbol (|) are
# removed. These two definitions are equivalent:
#
#   Voltage=Volts|V
#   Voltage = Volts | V
#
# The phrase to the left of the equals sign may contain more than one
# word, in which case spaces should be escaped with a backslash (\):
#
#   Fiber\ Optic = F/O
#
# Note: The left-hand side of the equals sign is matched without regard
# to case. The right-hand side alternatives are used verbatim. For example,
# these definitions are equivalent:
#
#   Volts = V
#   volts = V
#   vOlTs = V

Volts = V
Amps = A

Fiber\ Optic = F/O
